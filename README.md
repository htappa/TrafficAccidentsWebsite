Motor Vehicle Accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and a major concern for most US cities. This website focuses on accidents in Denver, CO, where important insights on traffic accidents can be gleamed from police records that provide a high level of detail on individual incidents. Various types of visualizations are used to analyze this data, which successfully identify the locations where most accidents occur, the causes and associated factors that led to the accidents, the monthly trends, and frequency distributions by day of the week and by hour. 

The dataset includes records of crashes that were reported to the Denver Police Department that occurred within the City and County of Denver during the previous four calendar years (2015-2018).

The analysis is divided into three categories:

- Map of the accident locations
- The causes of the accidents
- The number of crashes per month and frequency distributions of crashes by day and by time of day
